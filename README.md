# BankAccountProject
The Bank Account Project will manage the transactions of one bank client.  
The program will have a main menu that allows the client to choose and perform several banking transactions.
The program always maintains an accurate account balance for the client.
Additionally, all of the client's transactions are maintained in separate text files.
